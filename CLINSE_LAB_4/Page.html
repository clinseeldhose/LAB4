Developing a business plan that suits your purposes means tailoring it to your audience. 
Sometimes that can mean eliminating a section that isn�t applicable to your current project. 
If you�re writing this chapter for an internal business plan, you could approach writing a company overview as a status update on the company. How did you get to where you are today? Who is currently in charge?
<br>
</p>
<section><p>This is a Descendant</p></section>

<p>
Depending on who is viewing and working with the business plan in the company, this chapter may not be necessary. However, an employee who is new to the company or project may appreciate some background information and context.
If this plan is for outside use or investment, consider the perspective of your audience. They won�t know your team, facilities, or legal structure yet�you want to fill in the blanks for them in a polished and organized way. Present your company like it is well poised to accept their financial backing and hit the ground running.

A company profile is a formal introduction of your business. It informs others about the company's products and services. A well-written company profile creates a great impression on the audience. It's an effective way to introduce your company to your customers, creditors and other stakeholders.
<br>
If you are creating a company profile to place on your business website, you should structure it carefully so that users can easily navigate through important information, like company address, management team and contact details. A company profile listed in business directories and organizations, like Better Business Bureau (BBB), makes it easy for customers to find your company and learn about the products and services it offers.
<br>
You should write a company profile from the perspective of the reader and customize it for your target audience.</p>
